  <item><title>Cantonese Artificially-intelligent Phonetic Input Method—Thanksgiving Release</title><link>http://members.shaw.ca/akochoi/articles/cantonese-AI-phonetic-IM-thanksgiving-release/index.html</link><description>
      This is a new bug fix release of my Cantonese Artificially-intelligent Phonetic (CAP) Input Method for macOS, Linux, and Windows 10.  Most significantly, a number of long standing bugs resulting in crashes have finally been removed in the Windows version.  If you have used CAP in Windows and experienced problems previously, please try this new version.  It's a lot more stable.  Also, its SLM has been updated and new words and pronounciations have been added.

      Here’s yet another release of my Cantonese Artificially-intelligent
      Phonetic (CAP) Input Method for macOS, Linux, and Windows 10.  Its
      statistical language model now incorporates the 2021-04-01 Chinese and
      Cantonese versions of the Wikipedia, among other sources.  A small change
      to the macOS version allows the candidate window to be displayed correctly
      under either dark or light mode setting.

      Here’s the latest release of my Cantonese Artificially-intelligent
      Phonetic (CAP) Input Method for macOS, Linux, and Windows 10.  Its
      statistical language model now incorporates the 2019-08-02 Chinese version
      of the Wikipedia, among other sources.  I also corrected the
      pronounciation of some words such as 鵪鶉 (am chun), 芫茜 (yim sai), and 猥瑣
      (wui soh).  This release also uses a new and prettier icon.

  <item><title>CAP — a Cantonese Artificially-intelligent Phonetic Input Method</title><link>http://members.shaw.ca/akochoi/articles/CAP/index.html</link><description>
      The world deserves a better Cantonese phonetic input method!  The only true sentence-based, statistical-language-model-based (SLM-based) pinyin input methods is Sunpinyin, which is a highly usable input method.  But it’s difficult for most Cantonese speakers to type pinyin (which requires thinking in Mandarin).  Numerous experiments on and variants of input methods based on SLMs have been written about in the literature, which claim to have very high recognition accuracies.  I’ve always wondered why these research results, if they’re so good, have never made it to production.  One can only speculate.  What I’d call “bells-and-whistles” input methods such as Google Pinyin, Sogou Pinyin, Microsoft Pinyin, and Yahoo! Input Method all appear to use word bigrams in some capacity, and/or a very large word dictionary.  That makes them nice to use, but not as accurate as Sunpinyin, which means more time spent in “word selection”.  Cantonese phonetic input methods based on SLMs have simply not existed, until now.  All Cantonese speakers should read on: CAP will change the way you type Chinese!

It uses the new character and string types defined in C++0x so future compatibility with this upcoming standard is ensured.  An iterator is also provided for sequential access to code points in UTF-16 encoded strings.

It concludes with a performance comparison between Judy arrays and hashing when applied to a simple dictionary lookup problem.

      This is a summary of my experience in setting up a programming environment for writing literate Haskell programs on my Mac OS X and Linux machines.  It also includes a list of hints and resources that one’d need to get started in programming in Haskell.  The search for a good text markup language for literate programming led me to a new way of writing these Web articles.  I now use Pandoc, (X)Emacs, XSLT, and make files.  These are also discussed.

      In a paper I’ve just completed—Harmonic analysis of jazz chord sequences—I describe the T2 algorithm. This article explains some of the reasons I chose to work on this problem. There are (hopefully) also some insights into the state of computer music research and scientific research in general. Plus the question “is computer music more computer science or more music theory?”.

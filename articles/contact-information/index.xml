    <p>My Email address is “sixthhappiness <em>at</em> gmail <em>dot</em> com”.</p>
    
    <p>I welcome any thoughtful and cordial discussion of topics on computer programming and jazz improvisation that I have written about on these pages.  I also welcome questions and comments about CAP and other programs I have written, and my harmonic analysis paper and jazz theory in general.  I will do my best to respond to Email messages as promptly as possibly but I’m usually preoccupied with too many things these days.</p>
    
    <p>To my family, and friends from the past and in the present: your messages are of course always welcome.</p>
    
    <p>Andrew Choi.</p>

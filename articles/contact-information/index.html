<div class="abstract"><p>Here is my Email address etc.</p></div>
<div class="contents">
<p>My Email address is “akochoi <em>at</em> shaw <em>dot</em> ca”.</p>
<p>On a former version of this page, I went into some details to describe the kinds of correspondence I didn’t wish to get. Well, I’ve continued to get them anyway. Perhaps it’s unavoidable if one’s written code for moderately well-known free software projects, and when one’s Email address is posted publicly. Everyone wants to get a few words in, I guess.</p>
<p>And then there’re people who try to hire me to write little programs for them, and it always seems that they haven’t taken the time to read my <a href="../about-the-author/index.html">“About the Author” page</a> about my qualifications and experience. I don’t even know how to reply to these.</p>
<p>Let me just say instead that I welcome a thoughtful and polite discussion of topics on computer programming and jazz improvisation that I have <em>currently</em> written about on my website. Thoughtful and polite, please. I wouldn’t know how to reply to you otherwise :-).</p>
<p>To my family, and friends from the past and in the present: no, Andrew hasn’t gone off the deep end (yet :-)). You should see some of the Email I get! Anyway the fanaticism of free software, text editors, programming languages, the Apple Macintosh, etc., is a difficult thing to explain. Part of it is kids being opinionated, rude, disrepectful, egotistic, bullies, etc. As you know I dealt with a lot of that when I taught. But now I do this for recreation so I simply don’t have the patience. The Internet can be a pretty rude place. Your messages, however, are of course always welcome.</p>
